# Quick Start

## Setup

* Please refer to the [installation guide](../02-Installation.md) to setup your environment first

* Install finetune dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install "cogkit[finetune]@git+https://github.com/THUDM/CogKit.git"
   ```

* We provide various training scripts and example datasets in the `CogKit/quickstart` directory. Please clone the repository before training:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/THUDM/CogKit.git
   ```

## Data

Before fine-tuning, you need to prepare your dataset according to the expected format. See the [data format](./03-Data%20Format.md) documentation for details on how to structure your data

## Training

:::info
We recommend that you read the corresponding [model card](../05-Model%20Card.mdx) before starting training to follow the parameter settings requirements and fine-tuning best practices
:::

1. Navigate to the `CogKit/` directory after cloning the repository
   ```bash
   cd CogKit/
   ```

2. Choose the appropriate training script from the `quickstart/scripts` directory based on your task type and distribution strategy. For example, `train_ddp_t2i.sh` corresponds to DDP strategy + text-to-image task

3. Review and adjust the parameters in the selected training script (e.g., `--data_root`, `--output_dir`, etc.)

4. [Optional] If you are using ZeRO strategy, refer to `quickstart/configs/accelerate_config.yaml` to confirm your ZeRO config file and number of GPUs.

5. Run the script, for example:

   ```bash
   cd quickstart/scripts
   bash train_ddp_t2i.sh
   ```

## Load Fine-tuned Model

### LoRA

After fine-tuning with LoRA, you can load your trained weights during inference using the `--lora_model_id_or_path` option or parameter. For more details, please refer to the inference guide.

### ZeRO

After fine-tuning with ZeRO strategy, you need to use the `zero_to_fp32.py` script provided in the `quickstart/tools/converters` directory to convert the ZeRO checkpoint weights into Diffusers format. For example:

```bash
cd quickstart/tools/converters
python zero2diffusers.py checkpoint_dir/ output_dir/ --bfloat16
```

During inference, pass the `output_dir/` to the `--transformer_path` option or parameter. For more details, please refer to the inference guide.
